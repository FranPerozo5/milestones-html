<body>
  <p>For this section, we will focus on this snippet:</p>
  <img height="70px" src="snippet.png">
  <p>The snippet has 2 tags, the paragraph tag <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, which represents a paragraph in an HTML document; and the anchor tag <code>a</code>, that creates a hyperlink or link.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/html-tags">This website</a> provides an alphabetic list of HTML tags for reference.</p>
  <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">Mozilla.org</a> is one of the most reliable technical references in the coding world according to Jesse.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/most-commonly-used-tags-in-html/">This website</a> has the most commonly used tags in HTML.</p>
  <p><code> &lt;p&gt;</code> is the opening tag and <code> &lt;/p&gt;</code> is the closing tag. Anything in between is written in paragraph format.</p>
  <p><code> &lt;p&gt;</code> is the opening tag and <code> &lt;p&gt;</code> is the closing tag. It has attributes and values.</p>
  <p>Attributes are extra bits of information which can be added to a tag. The purpose of attributes is to add extra information to the tag which can also be used to style the element. Attributes always appear within an opening tag and the value of the attribute always appears in quote marks.</p>
  <p>In the example above, there are 4 attributes:</p>
  <div><ul>
    <li><code>&lt;href&gt;</code> is used to specify the URL of the page that the link goes to. Each value is <code>http://google.com</code>.</li>
    <li><code>&lt;id&gt;</code> is used to specify a unique identidication for an HTML to facilitate styling in a style sheet or JavaScript. Its value is <code>the-best-link</code>.</li>
    <li><code>&lt;class&gt;</code> is used to specify one or more class names for an HTML to facilitate styling in a style sheet or JavaScript. The only difference between them is that “id” is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements. Its value is <code>banana</code>.</li>
    <li><code>&lt;target&gt;</code> is used to specify where the linked document will open when the link is clicked. Its value is <code>_blank</code>, which mwans that it opens the link in a new window.
